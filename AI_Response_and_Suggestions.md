# Tise.com Scraping Project - Analysis and Suggestions

## Analysis of Your Requirements

Based on your notes, you want to:
1. Monitor specific profiles on Tise.com for new posts
2. Check periodically for new content
3. Download new posts (avoiding duplicates)
4. Skip already downloaded content

## Suggestions and Questions

### 1. **Technical Approach**
- **Python is an excellent choice** for this project. Libraries like `requests`, `BeautifulSoup4`, `selenium`, and `scrapy` are perfect for web scraping.
- Consider using `sqlite3` for a lightweight database to track downloaded posts.

### 2. **Storage Strategy**
**Question**: What type of content are you looking to download from the posts?
- Images only?
- Post metadata (descriptions, prices, etc.)?
- User information?

**Suggestion**: Use a hybrid approach:
- **Local folder structure** for downloaded files (organized by profile/date)
- **SQLite database** to track metadata and prevent duplicates

### 3. **Checking Frequency**
**Questions**:
- How active are the profiles you're monitoring?
- Are you looking for real-time updates or is a delay acceptable?

**Suggestions**:
- Start with **15-30 minutes intervals** to avoid being blocked
- Implement **exponential backoff** if no new content is found
- Add **random delays** between requests to appear more human-like

### 4. **Duplicate Detection Strategy**
**Questions**:
- Should we identify duplicates by post ID, image hash, or content similarity?
- Do you want to track posts that are deleted and re-posted?

**Suggestions**:
- Use post URLs or unique identifiers as primary keys
- Consider image hashing for duplicate image detection
- Store timestamps for tracking when posts were first seen

### 5. **Technical Considerations**
**Questions**:
- Do you need to handle user authentication/login?
- Should the app run as a background service?
- Do you want notifications when new content is found?

**Suggestions**:
- Implement **rate limiting** and **user-agent rotation**
- Add **logging** for monitoring and debugging
- Consider **headless browser automation** if the site uses JavaScript heavily

### 6. **Project Structure Suggestion**
```

```

## Recommended Libraries and Tools

### Core Libraries:
- `requests` - HTTP requests
- `beautifulsoup4` - HTML parsing
- `sqlite3` - Database (built-in)
- `schedule` - Task scheduling
- `logging` - Application logging

### Optional (depending on site complexity):
- `selenium` - Browser automation if JavaScript is heavy
- `scrapy` - Full-featured scraping framework
- `Pillow` - Image processing
- `hashlib` - For duplicate detection

## Next Steps

To proceed with building this application, I need to know:

1. **Example profile URLs** you want to monitor?
2. **Content type** you want to download (images, metadata, etc.)?
3. **Preferred checking interval** (every 15 min, hourly, etc.)?
4. **Authentication requirements** - do you need to log in?
5. **Notification preferences** - how should you be alerted of new content?

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

- **Respect robots.txt** and terms of service
- **Implement reasonable delays** between requests
- **Don't overload the server** with too frequent requests
- **Consider the site's API** if available as an alternative
