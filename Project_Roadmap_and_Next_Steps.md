# 🚀 Tise.com Scraper - Project Roadmap & Next Steps

## 📋 Current Status
✅ **Complete Python scraper framework built**  
✅ **User requirements gathered**  
✅ **Project structure defined**  

## 🎯 Your Specific Requirements Summary

### Technical Decisions Made:
- **Language**: Python ✅
- **Content**: Images + metadata (for duplicate prevention) ✅
- **Authentication**: None needed (public profiles) ✅
- **Environment**: Python virtual environment ✅
- **Focus**: Easy to maintain & expand to other websites ✅

### Smart Choices for Your Use Case:
- **Start with manual testing** ✅
- **Later automate with 15-30 min intervals** ✅
- **Include metadata for better duplicate detection** ✅
- **Build modular for other websites** ✅

## 🏗️ Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Testing (CURRENT)
**Goal**: Get basic scraper working with manual testing

**Steps**:
1. ✅ Set up Python virtual environment
2. ✅ Install requirements 
3. 🔄 **NEXT**: Get example Tise.com profile URLs from you
4. 🔄 **NEXT**: Analyze Tise.com HTML structure 
5. 🔄 **NEXT**: Update scraper selectors for Tise.com
6. 🔄 **NEXT**: Test with one profile manually
7. 🔄 **NEXT**: Verify downloads work correctly

**Why this order**: Start simple, test early, build confidence

### Phase 2: Optimization & Anti-Ban (LATER)
**Goal**: Make it production-ready and ban-resistant

**Steps**:
1. Implement exponential backoff
2. Add random delays between requests
3. User-agent rotation 
4. Consider Brave/TOR integration for IP protection
5. Rate limiting improvements
6. Error handling enhancement

**Why later**: Get it working first, then make it robust

### Phase 3: Automation & Notifications (FUTURE)
**Goal**: Full automation with smart notifications

**Steps**:
1. Automated scheduling (2-3 times per day)
2. Windows notifications for new posts
3. Email/Discord notifications (optional)
4. Advanced duplicate detection
5. Statistics dashboard

**Why last**: Nice-to-have features after core functionality works

### Phase 4: Multi-Website Framework (EXPANSION)
**Goal**: Template for other websites

**Steps**:
1. Abstract common scraping patterns
2. Plugin system for different websites
3. Unified configuration system
4. Shared duplicate detection
5. Cross-platform compatibility

## 💡 Smart Recommendations

### For Duplicate Prevention:
**Recommendation**: Use **both post URLs AND image hashes**

**Pros**:
- Post URL catches exact reposts
- Image hash catches same image with different URLs
- Metadata helps identify similar posts
- Very reliable duplicate detection

**Cons**:  
- Slightly more complex
- Uses more storage for hashes

**Real Scenario**: If someone deletes and reposts the same item, URL changes but image hash stays the same = still detected as duplicate ✅

### For IP Ban Prevention:
**Recommendation**: Start simple, add complexity later

**Phase 1 Approach**:
- 2-5 second delays between requests
- Don't check more than once every 15 minutes
- Test with 1-2 profiles max

**Later Enhancement**:
- Integrate with Brave browser's TOR mode
- Rotate user agents
- Use proxy rotation if needed

**Real Scenario**: Tise.com likely has basic rate limiting. Starting respectful prevents immediate bans, gives you time to understand their limits.

### For Easy Maintenance:
**Recommendation**: Modular design with clear separation

**Structure Benefits**:
- Each website gets its own selector file
- Common functions shared across all scrapers  
- Easy to debug specific issues
- Simple to add new websites

**Real Scenario**: When Tise.com changes their HTML, you only update one file. When adding Instagram scraping, you copy the pattern.

## 🔧 Technical Recommendations

### Python Environment Setup:
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv tise_scraper_env

# Activate it
tise_scraper_env\Scripts\activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Testing Strategy:
1. **Start with ONE profile** - avoid overwhelming yourself
2. **Run manually first** - understand what's happening  
3. **Check logs frequently** - catch issues early
4. **Verify file structure** - make sure downloads are organized correctly

### Metadata to Collect (for duplicates):
- Post URL (primary key)
- Image URLs and hashes
- Post title
- Price
- Description (first 100 chars)
- Timestamp when scraped
- Profile username

## ⚠️ Important Reminders

### For Later Implementation:
- **Exponential backoff**: If no new posts found, check less frequently
- **Random delays**: 2-8 seconds between requests (appears more human)
- **Respect robots.txt**: Check Tise.com's robots.txt file
- **Monitor response times**: If they get slow, you're being rate limited

### For Multi-Website Future:
- Keep website-specific code in separate modules
- Use configuration files for each site
- Abstract common patterns (login, pagination, etc.)
- Build a plugin system early

## 🎯 Immediate Next Actions

### What I Need From You:
1. **Example Tise.com profile URLs** (2-3 profiles you want to monitor)
2. **Confirmation to proceed** with Phase 1 setup

### What I'll Do Next:
1. Set up Python virtual environment  
2. Install all requirements
3. Analyze the profile URLs you provide
4. Update scraper for Tise.com specific structure
5. Create initial test run

## 📝 Questions for You (If Any)

Currently **no additional questions** - your responses were very complete! 

The next step is getting those example profile URLs so I can analyze Tise.com's structure and customize the scraper specifically for their website.

**Ready to proceed with Phase 1? Just provide the profile URLs and we'll start! 🚀**
